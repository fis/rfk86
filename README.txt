| rfk86 v0.2.GIT                                      |
| It is a zen simulator, hidden in a TI-86.           |
|                                                     |

| An Introduction                                     |
|                                                     |
| It is a port of robotfindskitten to the TI-86       |
| graphing calculator.  For more information, consult |
|            http://robotfindskitten.org/             |
|                                                     |
| To use, trans-re-mogrify the supplied rfk86.86p     |
| into your calculator by some unspecified means,     |
| then invoke "Asm(rfk86)" or use some sort of shell. |
| Use clear (or many other keys) to get past the      |
| introductionary splash screen, the arrow keys to    |
| move the eponymous, cubical robot, and the "exit"   |
| key to escape, if the suspense is too much for you. |
|                                                     |
| Kittens have eaten the developer's link cable, so   |
| this application has been so far tested only with   |
| an emulator.  It is very likely to work on a real   |
| calculator, but if it breaks, you have to fashion   |
| a modernist sculpture out of both pieces.           |
|                                                     |

| How to Compile It (if You have the Source Package)  |
|                                                     |
| There is a Makefile.  You need to have the "z80asm" |
| tool from                                           |
|     http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/z80asm      |
| (or the Debian/Ubuntu "z80asm" package) available   |
| in your path.  The "GD" Perl module is also needed, |
| to convert the PNG images.                          |
|                                                     |
| Possibly architectural documentation will also      |
| appear some day.  Now wouldn't that be nice?        |
|                                                     |
