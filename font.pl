# font.pl: rfk86 tiny unreadable font, png -> binary

# TI-86 screen is a monochrome thing; 128x64 pixels, with eight
# horizontal neighbor pixels packed into a single byte.  Our font
# characters are 4 pixels wide, so one nybble contains all the pixels
# of a single font row.  Since we always want to draw all the six
# rows, the font is stored in a "planar" format, consisting of six
# 38-byte blocks, each containing the corresponding row of 76
# characters.
